## I'm JosÃ© Luis ðŸ‘‹

Curious, with 13 years I pandorized the battery of my PSP and a few friends..., with 15 I bought my first Alpha wifi adapter, with 16 I configured my first Hackintosh while flashing ROMS in a Galaxy S.

I've been working as SRE for the last 4 years, mostly focus on observability field and keeping curiosity alive.
