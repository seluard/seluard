## Hola ðŸ‘‹! My name is JosÃ© Luis.

I'm a curious person, with 13 years I pandorized the battery of my PSP and a few friends..., with 15 I bought my first Alpha wifi adapter, with 16 I configured my triple boot Hackintosh (linux for distro hopping :) and windows for games on that time) while flashing MIUI ROMs in a Galaxy S (yes, S, without any number).

I've been working as SRE for the last 4 years, mostly focus on observability field and keeping curiosity alive.
